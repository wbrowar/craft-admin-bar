# Admin Bar Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## 4.0.0-beta.0 - 2023-11-24
### Added
- Added static translations for all string on admin bar.
- Added `rtl` config option that can be passed into `adminBar()` as `adminBar({ rtl: true })`.
  - _NOTE: Admin Bar will automatically adjust when the page reading direction is set to `rtl`, so this option is here for situations where you have to manually set it._

### Changed
- Admin Bar is now rendered as a web component, [Admin Bar Component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/admin-bar-component), instead of via a Twig template and custom JavaScript.
  - It’s rendered via the Shadow DOM, which means that Admin Bar is less likely to be affected by your front-end’s CSS.
  - More CSS Custom Properties can be changed to customize the look of Admin Bar.
- The `adminbar()` twig function has been deprecated and changed to `adminBar()` to better follow Craft Twig naming conventions.
