### Changed

  - Note there are changes in the CSS Custom Properties: `--admin-bar-bg-color` and `--admin-bar-bg`. Nothing should break, if you’ve overridden these in custom settings, but the behavior of `--admin-bar-bg` is slightly changed.

> {warning} Admin Bar’s composer package name has changed from `wbrowar/adminbar` to `wbrowar/craft-admin-bar`. Update your composer.json to point to [the new package on Packagist.](https://packagist.org/packages/wbrowar/craft-admin-bar)

### Added
- Added static translations for all strings on admin bar.
- Added `rtl` config option that can be passed into `adminBar()` as `adminBar({ rtl: true })`.
